                  <h2 class="post-title ">Ace your Technical Interview like a professional</h2>
                  <p>
                    While some people might not find tech job interviews nerve-wracking, for most of people (even those with
                    Computer Science or IT degrees), the interview process is the stuff anxiety dreams are made of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While you will certainly have come across some of the standard interview questions you can expect in
                    a
                    tech job interview (think: behavioral questions, questions about your technical skill set,
                    certifications, knowledge of project managemen t systems and the development process) tech
                    interviews
                    are notoriously unpredictable. Hello, nonsensical curveball questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>It can leave you feeling lost when it comes to preparing.
                    But there is no reason to panic. Ultimately, recruiters, tech companies, and other stakeholders are
                    interested in your communication skills and your problem-solving skills (sometimes more so than your
                    programming know-how).
                  </p>
                  <p>And their questions are designed to reveal how you think and work through problems — not to trip
                    you
                    up or embarrass you.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1. “WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR COMPANY?”</strong>
                    <br>Sound obvious? Sometimes the best technical interview questions are — and they’re more revealing
                    than you might expect.

                    Alan Hattman, Manager of Talent Acquisition at Peloton Technology, has a yikes-worthy story that
                    proves that the importance of research can’t be stressed enough: While he was looking to hire a
                    Director of Marketing, not one but two candidates thought they were interviewing for a different
                    company with a similar name.

                    “They thought we were a bike company,” Hattman says. (Peloton Technology is a vehicle technology
                    company. The interviewees had confused it with Peloton Cycle.) “They even talked about how they used
                    our product and everything. So those were automatic fails. Do your homework. Research the job and
                    the
                    company you’re applying for.”

                    When it comes to reading up on a prospective employer, Jenna Kass, Recruiting Manager at Tableau
                    Software, says she always appreciates when “candidates take the time to research our company from a
                    business standpoint.” Before you walk into the interview, find out who the company’s competitors are
                    and gather information about their audience or customers.

                    The last step is to build on your research with your own expertise. ShipMonk CEO Jan Bednar asks
                    candidates for feedback about his company’s product—specifically for changes they’d make. His ideal
                    response “would not only explain what they would like changed but also how they would change
                    it.”</br>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>2. “WHAT’S THE MOST CHALLENGING/EXCITING PROJECT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE PAST TWO
                      YEARS?”</strong>
                    <br>Your work should lead the way in any technical interview and Lauren Thompson, Zillow’s
                    Communications Coordinator, says that in addition to technical specifications, Zillow’s interviewers
                    want to see “the innovation [an interviewee] comes out with from the project.” The goal of this
                    technical interview question? To figure out what you’re passionate about, she says.

                    You should start preparing for this question long before you send out resumes, and a safe bet is to
                    dig into each of your projects as you go to focus on what parts (of web development, app
                    development,
                    etc.) you’re passionate about, what motivates you, and what types of work you want to do in the
                    future.

                    Then, practice articulating that list, so if an interviewer asks you to explain a project from your
                    portfolio, you’ll have more to say than a simple list of specs.

                    Your answer might sound like: “I love 8-bit gaming, so I developed a C++ emulator for Chip-8. It
                    combined my interest in digital preservation with getting to dust off my Tetris and Pac-Man skills.
                    I’m looking forward to applying some of the C++ tricks I used to more projects in the future.”</br>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>3. “WHAT KIND OF TECH PROJECTS DO YOU WORK ON IN YOUR SPARE TIME?”</strong>
                    <br>The way an interviewee answers these types of questions shows Hayen “what in tech they are
                    really
                    passionate about or if they even are passionate about tech” in the first place.

                    It doesn’t matter what your hobby is: Talk it up with all the genuine enthusiasm you have.this
                    question also helps the company to figure out “how the candidate might fit into a particular team
                    and
                    what ‘bonus’ skills they might bring to the company” — things you didn’t even think to add to your
                    resume but will make you a more well-rounded applicant. </br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>4. “TELL ME ABOUT THE MOST DIFFICULT TECHNICAL CHALLENGE YOU’VE ENCOUNTERED AND HOW YOU
                      RESOLVED IT.”</strong>
                    <br>Bryan Petro, COO of GetMyBoat, asks this technical interview question to make sure prospective
                    employees can do more than check off a box when a problem is fixed. “We’re not looking for people
                    who
                    can just churn through bugs,” Bryan says, “but people who can understand the big picture as part of
                    a
                    larger product team.”

                    So that you’re not up all night before an interview, wracking your brain for every challenge you’ve
                    ever faced, try keeping a log of the times your skills were pushed to their limits and how you rose
                    to
                    the occasion as you work on projects. You don’t need to write essays here — a few bullet points to
                    jog
                    your memory will suffice.</br>

                      EasyTransit completely changed my life. Only 6 weeks after starting my first lesson, I was able to
                      land a flexible job at a media agency and am continuously growing my freelance web design/dev
                      business. Can’t say enough amazing things about the entire Easy Transit team and learning process!
                      Keep being awesome and empowering women to break into tech!

                      <p class="comment">
                        EasyTransit is AMAZING!!!!…I love how the courses and interview questions to expect are set up
                        and
                        are easily available when I need help. They’re like your own personal cheerleaders and cheer you
                        on the whole way!!! When feeling discouraged, I reach out and they always respond and provide
                        advice…I researched other courses, even free ones, but EasyTransit stood out to me knowing that
                        I
                        would have mentors and a community of others in my situation.
